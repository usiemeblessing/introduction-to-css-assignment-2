          Hi, I'm <b>Usieme Blessing Onome,</b> here is a short description of
          my love for Technology
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Technology</b> has the potential to change people's lives in ways
          that have never before been imagined in the history of the human race.
          My passion for technology is fueled by the notion that whatever I
          produce could have an effect on a person anywhere in the world, either
          now or in the future. And anyone can achieve it with the right skills
          and dedication!. My entire further career pursuit in technology has
          been shaped by an exceptional speech given by a Professor in an
          introductory clas.
          <em
            >"People frequently believe that networking is just about connecting
            computers, he claimed. It isn't. The goal is to connect people".</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, <b>Technology</b> excites me because it allows for the creation
          of better tools. By definition, tools assist with work. And
          ultimately, the work we do is about people. Part of my dreams is to
          build websites that will assist nonprofit organizations in connecting
          with their constituents and small enterprises in connecting with their
          clients. My obsession with the most recent technology for smart homes
          isn't about the technology itself; rather, it's about improving and
          enriching the lives of people. Any technology project has some very
          human problems underneath that are, presumably, being tackled in
          innovative ways.

      <div class="section second-section">
        <p>
          So far, I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS and still learning.
          But most importantly, are the following foundational lessons I have
          learnt and still learning also. And a few are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Web development is complex, and it is absolutely impossible to know
            every single thing. You'll experience not knowing a lot of things
            other people talk about at some point. But It's ok. Things become
            more apparent over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having a mentor help cut my learning curve by quite a lot. It is
            very important and very safe to always reach out for help. And
            asking for help does not mean, you are not good enough
          </li>
          <li>
            When you learn the foundations first, then it will be much easier
            for everything else to make sense.
          </li>
          <li>
            You won't know everything right off the bat. You won't learn
            everything in a short time. You'll also make mistakes. And thers
            will point out your mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Build real applications as often as possible: </b>They don't have
            to be complex applications. It can be a to-do list or a pounds to
            kilograms converter in JavaScript. It can be a portfolio website in
            pure HTML and CSS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>CSS</b> is used to enhance the front-end of a website, it also
          improves user experience. Websites without <b>CSS</b> would certainly
          be substantially more difficult to browse and less aesthetically
          pleasant. <b>CSS</b> is in charge of font color in addition to layout
          and format.

          Difference between Padding, Margin and Border
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Padding: </b>Padding is a technique for separating the content of
          an element from any set borders.
          <br />
          <b>Margin: </b>The CSS margin properties are used to create space
          around elements, outside of any defined borders. <br />
          <b>Border: </b>The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that
          accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is
          applied to.
